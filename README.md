## From monolith to decoupled‚Ä¶wait, why is that one getting bigger?!?

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Monolithic apps are getting broken down left and right into dedicated services and teams, all under the banners of separating concerns, higher efficiency, and more. The strategy that is implemented will be crucial to ensure decoupling is a beacon of efficiency and not a migration nightmare.

In this talk, we‚Äôll discuss how decoupling following the strangler fig approach will seem counter-intuitive, as your monolith continues to grow alongside your new decoupled architecture. But this approach, when done right, makes dismantling a monolith a process that is structured and safe, slow but agile, and without major service interruptions or massive interface changes that shock and discombobulate users. We will look at the experience of Platform.sh‚Äôs customer experience engineering team who are midstream on moving from a monolith to a decoupled suite of mircroservices that support every aspect of user interaction with our products.</dd>

## GNAP: The future of OAuth

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>OAuth 2 is an industry-standard for authorization that every developer probably heard about.
As hinted by its name, it is the evolution of OAuth 1 and as such; it aims to address most of its known issues.

But, just like OAuth 1, OAuth 2 now has a lot of known issues.
Fortunately, a lot of these issues have been already fixed by extending the specification. The drawback of this is that today, in order to get OAuth2 right, one needs to read a dozen of RFCs and make sure they are relevant to the use case. This hurts developer experience as it increases the complexity of the protocol, which goes against its main focus: simplicity for client developers.

Here comes GNAP (Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol): an in-progress effort to develop the next-generation authorization protocol by learning from the past.

In this talk, we'll have a deep look into the GNAP protocol, passing by a review of the known OAuth2 flaws that it aims to fix, how it plays with authentication protocols such as Open ID Connect or WebAuthN, what is its current state and more.</dd>

## Dilemmas and decisions. What we've learned designing new Sylius API

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Sylius and API Platform integration is the project that we started in early 2020. Since then, we were working hard designing, delivering and adjusting our new API. We've learned a lot and during my presentation, I would like to share our findings.

Why did we design our API this way?
What were our heuristics and what did we achieve?
How to design more complicated flows in API?</dd>

## Transactional vs. Analytical Processing

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>When it comes to the design of your Symfony application, data plays a central role. From an architectural point of view there are two common ways this data is processed. Transactional processing ensures that changes to your data are consistent and safe. Analytical processing aims to make even complex queries fast and efficient.
We should always consider the nature of processing while implementing our application‚Äôs use cases. So let's have a look at the main criterias, strategies and trade offs that will help us to navigate through all the options we have and see how we can bring your own data warehouse to life in your Symfony application leveraging tools like Doctrine, Messenger and more.</dd>

## Unleashing the power of lazy objects in PHP ü™Ñ

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Lazy-objects are a bit magical. They are created empty and populate themselves on-demand. They are useful when an object is heavy to instantiate but is not always used, like for example Doctrine entities or Symfony lazy-services.

But do you know how they work internally? In this talk, I'll tell you about the mechanisms provided by PHP to enable such use cases üßô. Because doing this sort of wizardry is not common practice, I'll also introduce you to two new traits that package those lazy-loading behaviors introduced in Symfony 6.2: one for virtual inheritance proxies, and one for ghost objects üëª.

While lazy objects used to require complex code generation, these new traits make it way easier to leverage them, opening up possible innovations; lazy arguments, lazy properties, or by-design lazy classes to name a few ones. What will you come up with? Let me know after you've seen this talk!</dd>

## Observability tools: Who's who?

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>When it comes to application observability, different categories of tools are at our disposal: static code analyzers, profilers, APMs, to name a few. Like any good tool, they usually serve a specific purpose. In this presentation, we will explore the differences between these tools, to whom they're dedicated, and see how complementary they are.</dd>

## Schr√∂dinger's SQL - The SQL inside the Doctrine box

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Why should someone care about SQL, when a developer can abstract it with Symfony and Doctrine into PHP code? With Doctrine the database is out of sight, the database is out of mind, but this is where problems can start. What impacts are there for a Symfony project and how can they be managed? This talk handles Doctrine's behaviour and how it can influence a database and queries, why SQL is still relevant despite having an ORM and how developers can influence SQL performance.</dd>

## PHPStan: Advanced Types

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>To develop safer and more reliable applications, we don't have to wait for progress in PHP language itself anymore. Plenty of advanced concepts known from other languages like generics, precise array shapes, or number ranges can be expressed in PHPDocs and verified by static analysis.

In this talk I'll introduce the new types that have recently been added to PHPStan and show you how to use them in practice.

You will learn:

* How you can use PHPDocs to provide and document extra type information to static analysers, IDEs, and developers working with your code.
* Advanced types that don't yet exist natively in PHP, but can be used in PHPDocs for developing of more type-safe codebase
* Type theory about union vs. intersection types</dd>

## Build apps, not platforms: operational maturity in a box

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Delivering applications today means being a part of a clearly defined and secure lifecycle ‚Äì something that validates revisions on provisioned infrastructure and monitors production continuously. Organizations grow ‚Äúplatform teams‚Äù to manage this complexity, defining and enforcing operational standards around a common platform built in-house that connects a number of tools and providers.

This can turn into an expensive moving target, one that‚Äôll leave your team reinventing the wheel forever ‚Äì spending less time on writing features as you focus on everything else around applications. Platform.sh provides a unified, secure platform powered by Git and an infrastructure abstraction that provides operational maturity out-of-the-box. You‚Äôll spend less time orchestrating all of your apps, and more time experimenting with new technologies, optimizing your code, and scaling all in one place.</dd>

## Symfony & Hotwire: an efficient combo to quickly develop complex applications

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>In December 2020, Basecamp released their first official version of the Hotwire suite. Combining the historic Turbolinks library with their Stimulus js micro-framework, it comes out a powerful combo for making complex applications while coding a fullstack Rails app. The Symfony team was quick to port the project to their ecosystem, and the results are amazing!

At Windoo we've been using the package symfony/ux-turbo suite since early 2021 to progressively replace our React legacy code. We've learned a lot about how to use it, the good practices to follow, the mistakes to avoid, and the tricky use cases to solve.

Forms, messaging, modals, asynchronous... I will show you very concrete applications of this library in your projects!</dd>

## How to handle content editing in Symfony

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Content editing is the process of letting users create rich content directly from your project. It goes from allowing users to write simple text comments to letting users write rich documents collaboratively in real-time. Due to the inherent risks of displaying user content on your platform, it is a difficult problem to tackle in a secure, scalable and feature-rich way.

Let's discuss how the HtmlSanitizer component, Symfony UX and Mercure can be used together to build amazing editing experiences for your users.</dd>

## Bring your own knowledge: The Shopware App System and platform.sh

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Getting into new ecosystems often is a huge investment of time and effort. In this talk, Niklas will show you an exception to the rule.

The exception consists of three things: A MIT-licensed, open-source e-commerce software called Shopware, the service platform.sh, and whatever programming knowledge you already have.

You will learn how to use your existing knowledge to create standalone services that hook into Shopware Shops with minimal effort from your site.

See what is possible, what you can do with the technology, where platform.sh fits the picture, and learn why it is worth trying the whole thing out.</dd>

## How to Instantly Upgrade your Legacy Symfony in Minutes

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Legacy code is side effect of any successful company. The longer your grow, the older your code is.

How can we deal with it? Rewrite? Gradual refactoring? Hire external developer team with legacy skills?

In 2022 there are tools that can handle like composer updates your dependencies. Any company or developer can refactor their huge legacy code in a couple of weeks. Bump PHP 5.3 to PHP 8.1? From PHPUnit 4 to 10 or Symfony 2.8 to 6.1?

You don't have to know a thing about the BC breaks and how-to-chagen it.
I will show you, how you can become master of change with simple command line.</dd>

## From a legacy Monolith to a Symfony Service Oriented Architecture with zero downtime

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Let's say you have a 15-year-old e-commerce site and you need to modernize it. You've probably heard of something like SOA or microservices and want to implement them. But you have no idea how to move from a monolith to SOA while maintaining live production the whole time.

In this talk, we'll walk you through how we approached this, what's the first step? How we leveraged the Strangler Fig Pattern (presented in Shawna Spoor's talk) with Symfony to set up our migration path. How to manage such an architecture on a daily basis? How do manage source code? How do we handle users's session between legacy and new apps? How do we benefit from Symfony's Container in the legacy part? How to hunt for bugs thanks to OpenTelemetry?

This talk will give you some tips from our experience.</dd>

## Headless possibilities

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Headless is a term emerged recently in the web industry. It was coined to describe a backend system that provides core features but doesn't provide delivery, just a REST API interface. Countless products like CMSes and eCommerce systems state being headless or at least having a headless mode. Is it something completely new or just good old "divide et impera"? In this presentation, we will explore the headless buzz, how it is related to decoupled architecture and API driven development, it's pros and cons. Also, what about the head?</dd>

## Modernizing with Symfony

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>A legacy application. It still earns the money, but maintaining the old code base is getting harder and harder. Feature development is too slow and the bug tracker is full of severe defect reports.

Rewriting the whole application is something your developers would simply love to do. But the rewrite probably won't go live before it's running out of budget.

Let's have a look at simple techniques that allow us to transform our legacy application step by step into a modern Symfony application.</dd>

## Painless authentication with Access Tokens

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>Via some simple but real scenarios, we will discover the power of the new AccessToken Authenticator shipped in Symfony 6.2. For example, we are developing a SaaS product, which exposes a private API. Our users can register many applications into their accounts, for each one we will generate an API Token that users must inject in their requests. Now, with a pinch of YAML and a dash of PHP, we will be able to authenticate users from their API Token. In this talk, I will show you how it also works with JWT and some other exotic tokens!</dd>

## Dynamic Validation with Symfony

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>It might happen on some of your API's endpoints, that the object your app is waiting for depends on the data sent. Say, the user sends `{type:foobar, data: XXX}`, then the `XXX` formats will depend on the type `foobar`.

So how can one validate this data if we don't even know its type ?
Well come on in, I'll show you how ! You can actually validate dynamic data by using the most of the features available in Symfony.</dd>

## The Evolution of Symfony: Now and to the Future!

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>With the release of 6.2, Symfony will contain somewhere near *500* new features from just the past 12 months! Wow!

And, while many of these are small, the landscape of *how* Symfony apps are developed continues to evolve. In this talk, we'll look at some of the most important changes, from new dependency injection attributes, framework-extra bundle features in Symfony, Symfony UX, testing, and more! Basically... a quick catch-up on 12 months, *thousands* of commits, and hundreds of releases across numerous repositories. Let's go!</dd>
